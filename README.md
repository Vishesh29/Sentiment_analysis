Essentially, sentiment analysis or sentiment classification fall into the broad category of text classification tasks where we
are supplied with a phrase, or a list of phrases and our classifier is supposed to tell if the sentiment behind that is
positive, negative or neutral. Sometimes, the third attribute is not taken to keep it a binary classification problem. 
In recent tasks, sentiments like "somewhat positive" and "somewhat negative" are also being considered.
The phrases correspond to short movie reviews, and each one of them conveys different sentiments.
